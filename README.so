# Checkers

Checkers is my first complex project. It's a game well known by everyone. There are 2
 players on two different sides. One of them is using white pieces, while the other one is 
 playing with the black ones. The real purpose of this game is to eliminate enemy's pieces
 in the smallest possible amount of moves.

## Game tutorial

The best way to play checkers is to open them in two different tabs:

Provide player names and hit START button on each tab. After clicking both START buttons, 
one of the player will have his turn and the second one will be forced to wait for the enemy's move.

To make a move just click on a piece. After that, possible moves will be selected with green color. 
Click on one of them. To deselect piece you have to click again on it, after that you will be able
to select other.

After you get to the enemy's side, your piece will be upgraded to queen. Queen can make moves 
on longer distances.

## Author's note

I am conscious that this project may contain some bugs or the code efficiency is not on the highest level.
However I am really proud of this, because I can gladly say, that I've done this project completely on my own.
